This is an example using the real robot, **Unitree GO2**, in the ROS2 ecosystem. If needed, it can also be run on ROS1.

## Prerequisites

In this example, the **Unitree GO2 Edu** model was used, and the setup was tested on **Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS2 Foxy**. If needed, it can also be run on **Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS1 Noetic**.

⚠️ **Note**: For the Unitree GO2 Air and Pro models, SSH access may be restricted, so using the Edu model is recommended whenever possible.

## Quick Start
### 1. Network Setup

#### 1.1 Assigning static IP to the robot though router configuration: 

The Unitree GO2 and the user’s PC can be connected via SSH through the [GO2 Robot Interface](https://www.docs.quadruped.de/projects/go2/html/go2_driver.html#go2-network-interface).
However, by default, the Unitree GO2 does not have internet access, so you need to configure the router as described below to allow the Unitree GO2 to connect to the internet.

#### Requirements
- A router with Internet access
- A computer connected to the router via Wi-Fi or Ethernet
- Unitree GO2 connected to the router via Ethernet cable

#### Steps
- **Access the Router Gateway**
    - Make sure your PC is connected to the router.
    - Run `ifconfig` in the terminal to check the assigned IP address. In this example, the IP is `192.168.50.13`.  
    <img src="../images/unitree_go2_real_router_ip.png" width="500">
    
    - If the IP is in the form `192.168.x.x`, replace the last number with `1` and open it in a browser (e.g., `192.168.x.1`). In this case, it is `192.168.50.1`.  
    <img src="../images/unitree_go2_real_router_connect.png" width="500">

- **Login to the Router**
    - Enter the default username and password of the router.
    - If the credentials were previously changed, use the updated account information.
    - After a successful login, the router configuration page will be displayed.

- **Change Router Gateway Address**
    - Navigate to **Advanced Settings → LAN** (the menu name may vary depending on the manufacturer/model).
    - Change the router’s IP address to `192.168.123.1`.  
    <img src="../images/unitree_go2_real_router_ip_change.png" width="500">
    
    - Reason: The Unitree Go2 robot has a fixed IP address of `192.168.123.18`, so the router must assign addresses in the same subnet `192.168.123.x` to enable communication.

- **Assign a Static IP**
    - By default, the router uses DHCP to dynamically assign IP addresses.
    - However, after disconnection/reconnection, the Unitree Go2’s IP may change. To prevent this, configure a **static IP assignment**.
    - Go to the **DHCP menu**.
    - Enable **Manual Assignment**, enter the Unitree Go2’s **MAC address**, and set the IP address to `192.168.123.18`.  
    <img src="../images/unitree_go2_real_router_dhcp.png" width="500">
    
    - Note: Most routers can automatically detect the MAC address (depending on the model).

#### 1.2 Assigning Dynamic IP

**Note**: Use the following method when you **do not have** admin access to the router 

**Steps**: 
- **Connect your robot to the computer:**

    - Connect the `Unitree GO2` to your computer via ethernet
    - Go to your network settings, and the select the one where the robot is connected. 
    - Inside the `TCP/IP` section, change the IP Address to `192.168.123.100` with a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`
    - Use `ifconfig/ipconfig`. The robot should be connected to your computer at the IP address `192.168.123.18`
    
    - Connect to the robot at: 

        ```
        ssh unitree@192.168.123.18 
        ```

- **Connect your robot to the shared Wi-Fi:**

    - Open the following file inside the terminal: 
        ```
        sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
        ```
    - Add the following: 
        ```
        ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
        update_config=1
        country=IN

        network={
            ssid="Wifi Name"
            psk="Password"
        }
        ```
    
    - Reset the connection to `wlan0` to connect to wifi: 
        ```
        sudo pkill wpa_supplicant
        sudo rm -rf /var/run/wpa_supplicant/wlan0
        sudo ip link set wlan0 down
        sudo ip link set wlan0 up
        sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
        sudo dhclient -v wlan0
        ```
    
        **Tip:** You add the following commands in an executable shell script to avoid running the commands everytime manually    

    - The robot should be assigned with a dynamic IP in the format `10.x.x.x`
    - `SSH` into the robot using the assigned IP in a new terminal 
    
    - After a successful connection you can remove the ethernet from your computer and the robot 


- **Check Connectivity**
    - After completing the above steps, check the connectivity between your PC and the Unitree Go2.
    - You can use the `ping` command in the terminal to verify the connection:
      ```
      ping 192.168.123.18
      ```
    - If you receive replies, the connection is successful.

- **SSH Access**
    - You can access the Unitree Go2 via SSH using the following command:
        ```
        ssh -X unitree@192.168.123.18
        ```
        or
        ```
        ssh -X unitree@10.x.x.x     #USE YOUR ASSIGNED IP
        ```

    - The default password is `123`.
    - After logging in, you can select the ROS version (ROS1 Noetic or ROS2 Foxy). In this example, Select ROS2 Foxy.

- **Check Internet Access**
    - Verify that the Unitree Go2 has internet access by running:
        ```
        ping google.com
        ```
    - If you receive replies, the internet connection is working properly.

### 2. Install rosbridge (Unitree GO2 side)
On the Unitree GO2, install rosbridge to enable communication with the **ros-mcp-server**.
```bash
sudo apt install ros-foxy-rosbridge-server
```

### 3. Choose and Build Control Package
You have two options for controlling the robot.

### Option A: Using the `go2_ws` workspace
The `go2_ws` workspace exposes the different GO2 sports mode functions as ROS2 services, which the MCP can call to control the robot. 

Examples of different actions as service nodes:
- **Posture**: `/go2/stand_up`, `/go2/sit`, `/go2/recovery`, `/go2/balance`
- **Movement**: `/go2/move` (Handles velocity *and* distance/duration automatically)
- **Tricks**: `/go2/dance1`, `/go2/front_flip`, `/go2/hello`, `/go2/stretch`

**[See detailed setup instructions in go2_ws/README.md](./go2_ws/README.md)**

**Setup Summary:**
1. Install dependencies (`unitree_sdk2py`).
2. Copy the `go2_ws` folder to the robot.
3. Build the workspace on the robot using `colcon build`.

#### Option B: Standard `unitree_go` Package
[`unitree_go`](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros2) is the official ROS2 package provided by Unitree Robotics. It provides low-level control and standard topics but fewer high-level "skills" out of the box.

To build the `unitree_go` package, follow these steps:
- **clone the repository** (User PC side)
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros2.git
    ```
- **move the package to the Unitree GO2's workspace** (User PC side)
    ```bash
    cd unitree_ros2/cyclonedds_ws/src/
    scp -r unitree unitree@192.168.123.18:/home/unitree/cyclonedds_ws/src/
    ```
- **build the package** (Unitree GO2 side)
    ```bash
    cd ~/cyclonedds_ws
    colcon build --symlink-install
    ```
- **source the workspace** (Unitree GO2 side)
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

--- 

### 4. Setup Camera Script (User PC side)
By default, the Unitree GO2 publishes camera data through a custom topic called `/frontvideostream`. To convert this custom topic into a standard ROS2 topic, you can upload and run the following script on the Unitree GO2.

- **move the script to the Unitree GO2** (User PC side)
    ```bash
    cd /<ABSOLUTE_PATH>/ros-mcp-server/examples/4_unitree_go2/real_robot/scripts
    scp ./camera_bridge.py unitree@192.168.123.18:/home/unitree/cyclonedds_ws/src/image_process/
    ```
- **check the script** (Unitree GO2 side)
    ```bash
    cd ~/cyclonedds_ws/src/image_process/
    python3 camera_bridge.py
    ```
    If the camera is working properly, you should see the camera feed from the `/camera/rgb/image_raw` topic.
    
--- 

### 5. Launch rosbridge and camera script (Unitree GO2 side)
To enable communication between the **Unitree GO2** and the **ros-mcp-server**, you need to launch the following commands:

On one terminal, run:
```bash
# Launch rosbridge
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml
```
On a separate terminal, run:
```bash
# Launch camera script
cd ~/cyclonedds_ws/src/image_process/
python3 camera_bridge.py
```

## **Integration with MCP Server**
    
Once rosbridge is running on the Unitree GO2 and your PC is on the same network, you can connect the MCP server to control the robot. If you haven’t set up the MCP server yet, follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/robotmcp/ros-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/install/installation.md) .
    
Since The **ros-mcp-server** to recognize the robot, configure it to connect to the robot’s IP address.

### **Example 1** : Connect to robot
By default, the **ros-mcp-server** can access the Unitree GO2 robot on the same network as the user's local PC. Therefore, the IP address of the Unitree GO2 robot is `192.168.123.18`.
